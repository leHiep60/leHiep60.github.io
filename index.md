### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorite programming practices because it was my first time using the "command line" in our terminals.
    Rather than giving the computer inputs after running the program, we were coding it so the computer would take the arguments
    within the command line for the program.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 was another one of my favorites. Albeit, it was extremely tough. This was the first time we were introduced to object
    orientated programming which is a crucial concept in any programming language. We learned how to make "Pizza" objects and
    use them with the other various functions we built.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 is one of my favorites because of the logic and problem-solving involved. There wasn't any flashy loops
    or extensive use of functions but just figuring out which booleans and logic to use felt like a very interactive puzzle
    that I truly enjoyed.
